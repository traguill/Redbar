  winText: The feeling of terror is deeply embedded in her. Having been frightened
    out of her wits, she is incapable of overcoming the angst which has become her
    constant companion. She has been used to this feeling which she is still unable
    to get rid of. Just another night, like the previous, like the following.
  loseText: The sounds of weeping around her house and multiple somber black dresses
    embody this silent bitter end. But, nobody could hear her screaming last night,
    almost nobody.
  creditsText: "Thanks to play Game\u2019s name. We made this game with the objective
    to make aware people about how difficult can be go back home every single night
    for any girl these days."
